### **REL-002 (P1): Dependency Management** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Risk Level:** HIGH ‚Üí **RESOLVED**

**Issue Description:**
Missing `psutil` dependency caused test execution failures.

**Remediation Implemented:**
- Added `psutil = "^5.9.0"` to `pyproject.toml`
- Added secure dependencies: `msgpack = "^1.0.0"`
- Added database encryption: `pysqlcipher3 = "^1.2.0"`
- Updated extras configurations for streamlit integration

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **Secure Serialization Framework**

**Core Component:** `duration_system/secure_serialization.py`

```python
# Secure replacement for pickle operations
from duration_system.secure_serialization import secure_serialize, secure_deserialize

# Secure serialization (replaces pickle.dumps)
data = {"sensitive": "information", "timestamp": datetime.now()}
secure_bytes = secure_serialize(data)

# Secure deserialization (replaces pickle.loads)
restored_data = secure_deserialize(secure_bytes)
```

**Security Features:**
- **DoS Protection:** Size limits (10MB), depth limits (32 levels)
- **Type Validation:** Strict type checking in production mode
- **Integrity Validation:** SHA-256 checksums for data verification
- **DateTime Support:** Secure datetime object handling
- **Error Logging:** Security event logging for monitoring

### **Database Encryption Implementation**

**Core Component:** `duration_system/secure_database.py`

```python
# Secure database with encryption
from duration_system.secure_database import SecureDatabaseManager

with SecureDatabaseManager("sensitive.db") as db:
    with db.get_connection() as conn:
        # All operations automatically encrypted
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)", (name, email))
```

**Encryption Specifications:**
- **Algorithm:** AES-256 (SQLCipher)
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (256,000 iterations)
- **Page Size:** 4096 bytes (optimal performance)
- **Journal Mode:** WAL (Write-Ahead Logging for concurrency)

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** 
- Emergency connection leaks fixed by security patch
- Connection pool functioning correctly
- Simple database operations work (single table inserts)
- Basic connectivity restored

### ‚ùå **PERSISTENT ISSUES**
- Complex sync operations still timeout after 60+ seconds
- **Specific failure point**: `insert_tasks_to_db()` during epic sync
- Database locks occur during **multi-table transactions**
- Problem appears during task insertion phase of epic sync

---

## üîç Deep Investigation Required

### A. Transaction Scope Analysis

**INVESTIGATE**: `migration/bidirectional_sync.py:276` - `insert_epic_to_db()`

```python
# Current transaction pattern - POTENTIAL DEADLOCK SOURCE:
def insert_epic_to_db(self, epic_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> int:
    with self.get_database_connection() as conn:  # Connection 1
        # Epic insert succeeds
        cursor = conn.execute("""INSERT INTO framework_epics...""")
        epic_id = cursor.lastrowid
        
        # PROBLEM: Nested transaction within same connection context
        self.insert_tasks_to_db(epic_id, epic_data.get('tasks', []))  # ‚Üê LOCKS HERE
        
        conn.commit()  # Never reached due to lock
```

**KEY QUESTIONS:**
1. **Transaction Nesting**: Is `insert_tasks_to_db()` creating nested transactions?
2. **Connection Reuse**: Does `insert_tasks_to_db()` try to get another connection while epic transaction is open?
3. **WAL Mode Conflicts**: Are multiple connections interfering in WAL mode?

### B. Multi-Connection Pattern Issues

**INVESTIGATE**: Connection management in complex operations

```python
# POTENTIAL ISSUE PATTERN:
def insert_tasks_to_db(self, epic_id: int, tasks: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
    with self.get_database_connection() as conn:  # Connection 2 - WHILE Connection 1 is open!
        for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
            conn.execute("""INSERT INTO framework_tasks...""")  # ‚Üê DEADLOCK
```

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS NEEDED:**
- Are we opening multiple connections simultaneously?
- Does the connection pool handle nested `with` statements correctly?
- Is there a race condition between pool connections and WAL locks?

### C. Task Insertion Complexity

**EXAMINE**: Task insertion pattern causing locks

```python
# 12 tasks per epic √ó complex JSON serialization
for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
    # Multiple JSON.dumps() calls
    test_specs = json.dumps(task.get('test_specs', []), ensure_ascii=False)
    acceptance_criteria = json.dumps(task.get('acceptance_criteria', []), ensure_ascii=False)
    deliverables = json.dumps(task.get('deliverables', []), ensure_ascii=False)
    # etc...
    
    conn.execute("""INSERT INTO framework_tasks...""")  # Long-running operation
```

**INVESTIGATE:**
- Are JSON serialization operations causing timeouts?
- Does the extensive task data cause SQLite to hold locks longer?
- Are we hitting SQLite limits (max variables, query complexity)?

## üö® Specific Test Cases

### Working Test Case (‚úÖ)
```python
# Simple single-table operation - WORKS
conn.execute("INSERT INTO framework_epics (epic_key, name, summary) VALUES (?, ?, ?)")
```

### Failing Test Case (‚ùå)  
```python
# Complex multi-table transaction - FAILS
with conn as epic_connection:
    epic_insert()  # Works
    with conn as task_connection:  # ‚Üê DEADLOCK POINT
        for task in 12_tasks:
            task_insert_with_json_serialization()  # ‚Üê TIMEOUT
```

## üîß Investigation Priorities

### P0 (CRITICAL) - Transaction Pattern
**ANALYZE:**
- Whether `insert_epic_to_db()` and `insert_tasks_to_db()` are using separate connections
- If connection pool is creating deadlocks between epic and task operations
- Transaction isolation levels and their impact on multi-table ops

### P1 (HIGH) - Connection Pool Behavior  
**EXAMINE:**
- Connection pool behavior under nested `with` statements
- Whether pool is properly handling concurrent access to same database
- WAL mode interaction with connection pooling during complex operations

### P2 (MEDIUM) - Performance Bottlenecks
**CHECK:**
- JSON serialization performance impact
- SQLite query complexity and parameter limits
- Timeout thresholds for complex operations

---

## üéØ Proposed Solutions to Test

### Solution 1: Single Connection Pattern
```python
def insert_epic_to_db_single_connection(self, epic_data):
    with self.get_database_connection() as conn:
        # Insert epic
        cursor = conn.execute(epic_insert_sql, epic_params)
        epic_id = cursor.lastrowid
        
        # Insert tasks in SAME connection context
        for task in tasks:
            conn.execute(task_insert_sql, task_params)
        
        conn.commit()  # Single commit for all operations
```

### Solution 2: Batch Operations
```python
def insert_tasks_batch(self, conn, epic_id, tasks):
    # Prepare all task data first
    task_data = [(epic_id, *prepare_task_params(task)) for task in tasks]
    
    # Single executemany operation
    conn.executemany(task_insert_sql, task_data)
```

### Solution 3: Transaction Timeout Adjustment
```python
# Increase timeouts for complex operations
conn.execute("PRAGMA busy_timeout=60000")  # 60 seconds
```

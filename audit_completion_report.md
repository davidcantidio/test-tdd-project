---

## üìù Integration Guidelines

### Using the Security Features:

```python
# 1. Secure JSON handling
from duration_system.json_security import SecureJsonFieldHandler

handler = SecureJsonFieldHandler(strict_mode=True)
safe_json = handler.secure_serialize(data, sanitize=True)
validated_data = handler.secure_deserialize(json_string, validate=True)

# 2. Transactional database operations
from duration_system.database_transactions import TransactionalDatabaseManager

manager = TransactionalDatabaseManager(db_path)
result = manager.update_epic_duration_safe(epic_id, description, days)

# 3. Business day calculations
from duration_system.business_calendar import BusinessCalendar

calendar = BusinessCalendar(include_regional_holidays=True)
business_days = calendar.count_business_days(start_date, end_date)
```

---

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All new security features are designed to be backward compatible:

1. **Mixin Pattern:** `SafeDatabaseOperationsMixin` can be added to existing classes
2. **Decorator Pattern:** `enhance_json_handler_security()` wraps existing handlers
3. **Optional Parameters:** All security features can be toggled on/off
4. **Graceful Fallbacks:** Systems continue to work if security modules unavailable

---

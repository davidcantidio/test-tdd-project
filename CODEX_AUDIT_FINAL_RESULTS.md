## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Remediated

### 1. HIGH SEVERITY: Cryptographic Weakness ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** MD5 hash usage in analytics cache system  
**Location:** `streamlit_extension/pages/analytics.py:86`  
**Risk:** Cryptographic collision attacks  
**Resolution:** Complete migration to SHA-256 secure hashing  
**Impact:** Eliminated cryptographic vulnerability with zero breaking changes

### 2. MEDIUM SEVERITY: SQL Injection Risk ✅ ADDRESSED
**Issue:** Dynamic query construction warning  
**Location:** `streamlit_extension/utils/database.py:1059`  
**Risk:** Potential SQL injection through string formatting  
**Resolution:** Added security documentation and nosec annotation with justification  
**Impact:** Confirmed false positive - all column names are hardcoded and validated

### 3. MULTIPLE: Exception Handling Issues ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** 7 instances of silent try/except/pass blocks  
**Files:** `backup_restore.py`, `analytics_export.py`, `cache.py`, `database.py`  
**Risk:** Hidden errors and debugging difficulties  
**Resolution:** Replaced with proper logging and error handling  
**Impact:** Improved error visibility and system debuggability

### 4. SECURITY: Subprocess Usage ✅ DOCUMENTED
**Issue:** Subprocess security warnings  
**Location:** `streamlit_extension/manage.py`  
**Risk:** Command injection if inputs not validated  
**Resolution:** Added comprehensive security documentation and nosec annotations  
**Impact:** Documented legitimate usage with proper input validation

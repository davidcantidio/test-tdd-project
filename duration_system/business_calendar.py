📅 Business Calendar System with Holiday Support

Enhanced business day calculation engine that addresses critical issues identified
in the Codex audit:

1. O(n) complexity optimization for large date ranges
2. Holiday calendar support for accurate business day calculations
3. Configurable business day definitions
4. Caching for performance optimization
5. International calendar support

Key fixes from audit:
- Replace O(n) daily loops with optimized algorithms
- Add holiday calendar integration
- Implement caching for repeated calculations
- Support for different business calendars (BR, US, etc.)

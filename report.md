Executive Summary
The Duration System demonstrates a strong focus on transaction safety, secure hashing, and JSON validation; however, several enterprise‑grade gaps remain. Bandit flagged insecure pickle deserialization, and unit tests revealed an integrity issue in the cache subsystem. The module lacks documented controls for encryption at rest, rate limiting, and disaster recovery. Production readiness is not yet achieved.

Top 5 Findings

Insecure deserialization of untrusted data via pickle.load

Cache layer fails TTL‑expiration test, indicating unreliable persistence

Bandit scan confirms CWE‑502 risk (unsafe deserialization) with HIGH confidence

Missing evidence of rate limiting or DoS mitigation across modules

Lack of documented GDPR “right to erasure” workflows

Go/No-Go Recommendation: No-Go until critical deserialization and cache reliability issues are resolved.

Risk Matrix
Risk ID	Category	Severity	Likelihood	Impact Description	Evidence	Remediation	Effort	Priority
SEC‑001	Security	Critical	Medium	Arbitrary code execution via unsafe pickle.load	secure_serialization.py lines 491‑508, Bandit CWE‑502	Replace pickle with signed JSON or msgpack; enforce allowlists	2d	P0
REL‑002	Reliability	High	High	Cache may return corrupted data; TTL test fails	Pytest failure	Add file integrity checks, handle partial writes, expand test coverage	3d	P0
SEC‑003	Security	Medium	Medium	No rate limiting; susceptible to resource exhaustion	Absent in codebase	Implement per‑user rate limiting at API and DB layers	1w	P1
COMP‑004	Compliance	Medium	Low	No explicit GDPR erase/export mechanisms	No code paths handling user‑initiated deletion	Implement data-subject request APIs and audit logs	1w	P2
RES‑005	Resilience	Low	Medium	No documented backup/DR strategy in repository	Documentation gap	Define RPO/RTO, automate backups, DR drills	2w	P3
Testing
✅ bandit -r duration_system -q -f json -o bandit_scan.json

⚠️ pytest -q (1 failed, 9 passed, 5 skipped; cache TTL test failure, run interrupted)

Notes
Full 10,000‑user scalability, stress testing, and compliance certifications were not executed due to time constraints.

Additional dynamic analysis (e.g., fuzzing, DDoS simulation) is recommended before production deployment.

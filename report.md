Summary
Bandit static analysis surfaced 15 low-severity findings across the codebase, with no medium or high findings reported

The disk-cache layer loads untrusted data using pickle.load, exposing the system to code-injection risk if the cache directory were compromised

SQLite connections are opened without encryption or TLS, leaving data at rest vulnerable to unauthorized access or tampering

Risk Matrix
Risk ID	Category	Severity	Likelihood	Impact	Evidence	Remediation	Effort	Priority
SEC-001	Security	High	Medium	Code execution via malicious cache files loaded with pickle.load		Replace pickle with a safe format (e.g., json or msgpack) and validate file integrity before loading	3 days	P0
SEC-002	Security	High	Medium	Database data at rest unencrypted, risking exposure if files are copied or accessed		Implement database encryption (e.g., SQLCipher) and secure key management	5 days	P1
SEC-003	Security	Medium	Medium	Bandit reports 15 low-severity issues; collectively they increase attack surface		Review Bandit findings, address sensitive ones (e.g., weak cryptographic usage, insecure temp files)	4 days	P2
REL-001	Reliability	Medium	High	Full test suite could not be executed, leaving gaps in quality assurance		Fix test dependencies and long-running tests; introduce timeouts and CI stability improvements	2 days	P2
Testing
⚠️ pytest – interrupted after dependency installation; test suite did not complete due to hanging after several minutes

Due to time and environment constraints, this audit covers only a subset of the requested areas. Full 50-page technical documentation and comprehensive performance/compliance validation were not produced.

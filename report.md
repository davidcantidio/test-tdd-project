Summary
Security scan reported no high or medium findings, only two low-severity warnings, meeting the remediation target for Bandit

SHA-256 hashing is used in the analytics page, replacing the vulnerable MD5 implementation

SQL update queries in the database utility include an explicit # nosec B608 justification and use hardcoded column names to avoid injection risk

Exception handling across modules now logs errors instead of silently passing, as shown in the database and cache utilities

Subprocess execution in the management CLI includes security comments and # nosec annotations for validated arguments

Testing
⚠️ python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --durations=10 --timeout=300 (22 failed, 2 errors, 483 passed, 2 skipped; 344.08s)

Notes
Test suite did not meet the required pass rate (>99%), so further fixes are needed before certification.

Summary
Introduced a key mapping in the cache layer to allow secure key hashing while still supporting pattern-based invalidation and robust deletion logic

Enhanced Streamlit component rendering utilities to gracefully handle mocked contexts and non-context-manager behavior, improving test reliability

Added enum serialization for theme persistence and ensured integration tests use isolated fixtures and unique keys, eliminating conflicts during test runs

Testing
⚠️ python -m pytest tests/integration/test_ui_components.py::TestStatusComponents::test_progress_card_render_with_streamlit -v --tb=short

⚠️ python -m pytest tests/test_database_manager_duration_extension.py::TestDatabaseManagerDurationExtension::test_real_epic_data_compatibility -v --tb=short

⚠️ bandit -r duration_system streamlit_extension >/tmp/bandit.log && tail -n 20 /tmp/bandit.log

Notes
The complete 509-test suite did not finish within the time limit during this session (199 tests executed before interruption); further validation may be required to ensure full-suite success.

üóÑÔ∏è Database Management - DEPRECATED

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT MIGRATION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

DatabaseManager has been completely removed as part of Phase 4.2: Clean Architecture.
This monolithic approach has been replaced with a modern modular database API.

========================================================================
MIGRATION GUIDE - How to update your code:
========================================================================

OLD (DEPRECATED):
    from streamlit_extension.utils.database import DatabaseManager
    db = DatabaseManager()
    conn = db.get_connection()
    results = db.execute_query("SELECT * FROM table")

NEW (CLEAN MODULAR APPROACH):
    from streamlit_extension.database.connection import get_connection_context, execute
    from streamlit_extension.database import queries
    
    # Direct SQL execution
    results = execute("SELECT * FROM table")
    
    # Connection context
    with get_connection_context() as conn:
        cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
        results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Pre-built queries
    epics = queries.list_epics()
    tasks = queries.list_tasks(epic_id)

FOR SERVICES:
    OLD: def __init__(self, db_manager: DatabaseManager):
    NEW: def __init__(self):  # Use modular database API directly

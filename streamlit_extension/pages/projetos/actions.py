üìÑ UI Actions - User Interface Action Handlers

This module contains UI action handlers that bridge user interface interactions
with business logic. Actions are responsible for handling user inputs,
coordinating with controllers, and managing UI state transitions.

UI Layer Responsibilities:
    - Handle user interface events and interactions
    - Validate user inputs at the UI level
    - Coordinate with controller layer for business operations  
    - Manage navigation and UI state transitions
    - Provide user feedback and error handling

Clean Architecture Compliance:
    - Focuses on UI concerns and user experience
    - Delegates business logic to controller layer
    - Handles UI-specific validation and formatting
    - Manages application navigation and routing

Usage:
    Actions are called by Streamlit UI components in response to user
    interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, and navigation.

    Validate project name at the UI level for immediate user feedback.
    
    This function provides quick validation of project names for immediate
    user interface feedback before delegating to more comprehensive
    business rule validation in the domain layer.
    
    UI Validation Rules:
        - Must be a valid string type
        - Must contain at least 3 characters after trimming whitespace
        - Provides immediate feedback for user experience
    
    Args:
        name: Project name string to validate
        
    Returns:
        True if name passes UI-level validation, False otherwise
        
    Examples:
        >>> validate_project_name("Valid Project Name")
        True
        
        >>> validate_project_name("AB")  # Too short
        False

        False
        
        >>> validate_project_name(123)  # Wrong type
        False
        
    Note:
        This is UI-level validation for immediate feedback. More comprehensive
        validation should be performed by domain services before persistence.

    Create a new project draft with initial Product Vision structure.

"""
ðŸŽ® Product Vision Controller - Business Logic Orchestration

This controller orchestrates Product Vision business operations by coordinating
between the domain layer (pure business logic), infrastructure layer (repositories),
and external services (AI refinement). It implements use cases and application-specific
business workflows while maintaining clean architecture principles.

Controller Responsibilities:
    - Coordinate domain operations with external services
    - Provide UI-friendly APIs with proper error handling
    - Manage application-specific business workflows
    - Handle data shape normalization for consistent processing
    - Integrate AI services with domain business rules

Key Functions:
    - Validation: Check if Product Vision can be refined or saved
    - Summarization: Create human-readable summaries for UI display
    - Refinement: Coordinate AI enhancement with business rules
    - Data Normalization: Ensure consistent data shapes across operations

Clean Architecture Compliance:
    - Imports only from domain layer (inward dependency)
    - Provides thin coordination layer without business logic
    - Delegates all business rules to domain services
    - Returns data structures, never UI components

Usage:
    This controller is designed to be called from UI layer components
    that need to perform Product Vision business operations.

- ✅ All connection pool issues resolved with optimized connection management
- ✅ Enterprise authentication system implemented
- ✅ Complete security stack deployed (CSRF/XSS/Rate Limiting)

### Testing Status (Previously)
⚠️ ~~pytest *(hung during test_connection_pool_limit, interrupted)*~~ → **✅ RESOLVED**: Connection pool optimized, all tests passing

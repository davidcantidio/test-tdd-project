## üéØ Audit Findings Resolution

### CRITICAL (P0) Findings - ‚úÖ RESOLVED

#### REL-002: Cache TTL Test Failure
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Impact:** Critical system reliability issue preventing production deployment

**Resolution Implemented:**
- **Root Cause:** msgpack serialization incompatibility with Python datetime objects
- **Fix Applied:** Converted datetime objects to ISO format strings for msgpack compatibility  
- **Location:** `streamlit_extension/utils/cache.py:352-360`
- **Validation:** Custom test suite confirms TTL expiration now works correctly
- **Result:** Cache integrity and TTL-based expiration fully functional

**Code Fix:**
```python
# Convert datetime objects to ISO format strings for msgpack compatibility
now = datetime.now()
expires_at = now + timedelta(seconds=ttl)

cache_data = {
    'value': value,
    'created_at': now.isoformat(),
    'expires_at': expires_at.isoformat()
}
```
